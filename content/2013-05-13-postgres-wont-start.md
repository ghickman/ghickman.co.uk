Title: Postgres Won't Start
Status: published
Tags: Postgres

This problem has caught me out 3 times now so this post is partly just so I don't forget the cause again.


## The Symptoms
Starting or restarting Postgres (with either upstart or init.d) results in a detail-less error, telling you to check your log file. You check the log fileâ€¦ there's nothing useful in there, in fact Postgres might not have even been adding to the logs. The last bit there is what always catches my eye.


## The Cause
The amount of shared memory your OS provides is configured at the kernel level during *installation*. This part is important if you're hosting on VPSs and resizing them as the shared memory value won't change with the amount of RAM you provision.

Postgres has a setting called [shared_buffers](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/runtime-config-resource.html) which configures the amount of shared memory Postgres will consume. The docs suggest using 25% of your total memory value for this setting which is where I got into trouble downsizing VPSs.


## The Solution
There are two places you can fix this problem:

### Postgres
Lower the value of `shared_buffers` so it's within the range of your kernel's `SHMMAX`. You can cat `/proc/sys/kernel/shmmax` to find the value in bytes.

### The Kernel
Edit `/proc/sys/kernel/shmmax` (as root) and change the value it contains to something more suitable for your machine's memory value. Of course this is a brittle solution if you're resizing the machine. However it's a better solution if you wish to tweak the speed of your Postgres installation and are using config management.
