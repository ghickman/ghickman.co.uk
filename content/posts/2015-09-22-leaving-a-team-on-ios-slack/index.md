I recently tried to sign out of a team on Slack for iOS and found the process to be non-obvious and a lack of documentation made it harder. I'm writing this mostly for the next time I need to do it and have forgotten how.

Open the Team menu with the hamburger icon in the top right and tap Settings

![Team Menu](./slack-team-menu.png "Open your team menu…")

SCROLL DOWN. It's really not obvious that there is more to the settings page.

![Team Settings](./slack-team-settings.png "Scroll down…")

Tap the "Sign out of Team" link.
