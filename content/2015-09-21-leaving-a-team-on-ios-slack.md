Title: Leaving a Team on Slack for iOS
Status: draft


I recently tried to sign out of a team on Slack for iOS and found the process to be non-obvious and a lack of documentation made it harder. I'm writing this mostly for the next time I need to do it and have forgotten how.

Open the Team menu with the hamburger icon in the top right and tap Settings

<img class="center" alt="Team Menu" title="Open your team menu…"
     src="/images/slack-team-menu.png" style="width:50%;" />


SCROLL DOWN. It's really not obvious that there is more to the settings page.

<img class="center" alt="Team Settings" title="Scroll down…"
     src="/images/slack-team-settings.png" style="width:50%;" />

<p style="text-align:center;">Tap the Sign out of `Team` link.</p>

<img class="center" alt="Sign Out Link" title="Click the Magical Button!"
