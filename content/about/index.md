I help businesses and teams improve their software.
I specialise in Python, Django, and improving your development infrastructure.

## Python
I've been writing Python professionally since 2010, with a focus on web services and CLI tooling.
I'm the author of [classify](/posts/2013-06-23-classify/), a tool for generating concrete class API documentation for Python classes.

## Django
I've been using Django professionally since 2011, on sites both large and small.
I'm well versed in digging into its source code, fixing common problems, and determining which community packages are the best to use for a given situation.
I am the author of [django-cache-url](https://pypi.org/project/django-cache-url/) and a maintainer of [ccbv.co.uk](https://ccbv.co.uk) the definitive site for class-based view reference documentation.
