## [Tv Renamr](http://github.com/ghickman/tvrenamr)
Currently only a command line API and script to rename TV shows into the format "Show - 000 - Foo Bar". Written in Python Tv Renamr is open source and is available on the social hosting website [github](http://github.com/ghickman/tvrenamr). Once the API is polished off I will be documenting it properly and plan on adding some extra features, probably in the form of separate projects - such as watch folders for multiple platforms and eventually a GUI.

## [Penderry.com](http://penderry.com)
Penderry.com is a small website written in the PHP framework CakePHP. Providing a simple view of what Penderry Farm in Pembrokeshire has to offer, Penderry.com also provides an easy way for any potential visitors to contact the owners. Essentially a content management system there is a small admin section using the advanced [TinyMCE](http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/) layout as the editor. A Flickr account is tied into this to provide a list of images that the user can embed in a page.

## [Trackr](/trackr.html)
Trackr is a bug and defect tracking system built for my university dissertation. It was designed to overcome some of the short comings I saw in the workflow of the support team I was part of at a previous job. The system works on the philosophy that support tickets are open and available to all the relevant people thus decentralising the support process.
