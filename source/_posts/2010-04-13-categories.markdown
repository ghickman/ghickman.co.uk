Don't get too distracted. Be clear about the objective of the lesson and focus on it.

Anger management. 'Is there a volcano inside your tummy?'. If pupils have problems managing their anger, try showing photos of situations where people are angry and get them to suggest whats going on in the photo and teach them to identify the physical signs of being angry. Talk about good ways and bad ways to deal with the anger, e.g. hitting someone or damaging property vs taking deep breaths, counting to 10, running around the playground at break. Reassure them that its OK to feel angry, but its important to let those feelings out in a way that is not destructive to others.

If behaviour is challenging, it is often more effective to respond quietly and calmly (e.g. by talking firmly and quietly/writing names on boars /minutes of breaktime owed) than shouting. In fact, stay calm at all times. Do not panic.

Know the school's behavioural policy so that you know what sanctions can be given.

Ignore mild 'bad' behaviour if it is not affecting others' learning e.g. doodling on a piece of paper, playing with pens/curtain when you're talking. If it affects others' learning, respond, e.e. name on board.

Restraining pupils - know what the schools' strategy is for when and how pupils should be restrained. If a situation arises where you need to restrain a pupil, asap afterwards, report to senior staff.

If kids aren't working don't say "you're letting yourselves down". Point out what they can do to improve.
