Wow, is what you're thinking eh? A final return of the [youtube](http://youtube.com/) Friday, my weekly collection of music video's that I've listened to/watched throughout the week? Well yes... but I've decided to open the weekly event to more than just music...I've decided folks to open it up to any youtube video (what you're crazy!), that's right any video. Now before you all go shouting and all the craziness makes me want to become [Amish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amish) let me tell you this tonight's videos are of a music nature.

## Sleeping is the only love
How fucking creepy are his eyes in this video? The first video tonight is from one of my favrioute musical bands. [Silver Jews](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Jews). This song is off their 2005 album Tanglewood numbers (track number 6).

## Radiohead - 15 Steps (Seven)
This video is funny with Thom in a box, yay. 15 Steps is from their latest album In Rainbows and this video was on one of their webcasts. You can checkout [greenplastic.com](http://greenplastic.com) or [ateaseweb.com](http://ateaseweb.com) for some Radiohead fan sites.
