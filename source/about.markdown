My name is George Hickman, a 20 something developer from the west midlands and I write code. I specialise in beautiful, properly aligned and DRY code but anything's possible!

I have a Bachelors degree in Software Engineering from Aberystwyth University, Wales. I work in languages like Python, PHP, Java, HTML and Javascript, while sometimes I dabble in the frameworks Jekyll, Django, CakePHP and jQuery.

I have been and am currently involved in a number of projects, which are mostly listed on my [portfolio](portfolio.html) or available on my [Github](http://github.com/ghickman/) profile.
