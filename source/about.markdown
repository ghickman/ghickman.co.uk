My name is George Hickman, a 20 something developer hailing from the West
Midlands currently living in Oxford, via Wales and I write code. I studied
Software Engineering at Aberystwyth University in mid Wales, also known as The
Middle of Nowhere, where I snagged and bagged a Bachelors degree.

I've worked with a variety of technologies - starting with Java and C at
university, moving onto the Web Technologies (even a splash of Flash - sorry)
and finally ending up with Python. Somewhere along the line I started dabbling
in the web frameworks [Jekyll](http://github.com/richguk/jekyll),
[Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com), [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org),
[CakePHP](http://cakephp.org), [jQuery](http://jquery.com) and ended up working
in [Django](http://djangoproject.com).

Post-University I did some travelling around South-East Asia and India, ate
some great food, saw some different cultures, wake boarded, scuba dived,
abseiled down a few waterfalls, learnt to use chopsticks like a ninja,
discovered buckets, Lao Lao Whiskey, Tiger Whiskey and mostly got a banging tan.

After a short bout of freelancing I'm now working for an awesome web company in
Oxford, [Incuna](http://incuna.com), where I've been introduced to the wonderful
world of Django and all it's ORM'y, Pythonic goodness (can you tell I'm a fan?).

In my spare time I tend to hack around with web stuff, watch TV/films, read
Fantasy novels and ride bikes down mountains (and up too, but that's less fun).

I have been and am currently involved in a number of projects, which are mostly
listed on my [portfolio](/portfolio.html) or available on my
[Github](http://github.com/ghickman/) account.
